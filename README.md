# Delta
*Delta* is a framework for fluid function execution in heterogeneous computing environments. It is meant to represent the first step towards realizing the [*computing continuum*](https://www.slideshare.net/ianfoster/coding-the-continuum). 
*Delta* stands for **D**istributed **E**xecution of **L**ambdas using **T**rade-off **A**nalysis, and relies on existing platforms including [*funcX*](http://funcx.org/) and [*Globus*](https://www.globus.org/).

I built *Delta* as part of my masters project at UChicago, in close collaboration with the [*funcX* team](https://labs.globus.org/). You can read more about it [here](https://rohankumar.io/continuum_thesis.pdf). Comments and contributions are always welcome.
